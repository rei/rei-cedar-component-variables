cdr-component-variables
------------------

Component variables provide a versioned method for teams to import the exact CSS styles being used in the Cedar vue components and apply them to elements in their project. See the [Cedar docs](https://rei.github.io/rei-cedar-docs/foundation/component-variables/) for more high level information about component variables.

## Supported Components

See the [docs page](https://rei.github.io/rei-cedar-component-variables/#/) for a list of supported components and examples of how they can be used.
If there is a component that you would like to see supported, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/rei/rei-cedar-component-variables/issues).
If you are trying to build a component that is not in Cedar, you should instead use the [design tokens](https://github.com/rei/rei-cedar-tokens).

## Install

The component variables inherit values from the design tokens, so you will need to install both packages:

`npm install --save-dev @rei/cdr-tokens @rei/cdr-component-variables`

Your project must be able to compile SCSS or LESS in order to make use of this package.

This package contains `/dist/less` and `/dist/scss` folders, each of which contains `*.vars.{less|scss}` for each component, as well as an `index.{scss|less}` that imports all of those files. It is recommended that you use the `index` file to ensure that all variables are loaded in the correct order. A `dist/{scss|less}/cedar-component-variables.{scss|less}` file is also available which concatenates all of the variable files together.

## Usage

SCSS example:
```
@import '@rei/cdr-tokens/dist/scss/cdr-tokens.scss'; /* import the tokens file */
@import '@rei/cdr-component-variables/dist/scss/index.scss'; /* import the component variables */

.your-button-class {
  /* use mixins to apply many properties at once */
  @include cdr-button-base-mixin;
  @include cdr-button-primary-mixin;
}

```

LESS example:
```
@import '@rei/cdr-tokens/dist/less/cdr-tokens.less'; /* import the tokens file */
@import '@rei/cdr-component-variables/dist/less/index.less'; /* import the component variables */

.your-button-class {
  /* use mixins to apply many properties at once */
  .cdr-button-base-mixin();
  .cdr-button-primary-mixin();
}

```

The [docs page](https://rei.github.io/rei-cedar-component-variables/#/) demonstrates which mixins to use to achieve various styles for each supported component.

You can find all of the exported mixins in the [/dist directory](https://github.com/rei/rei-cedar-component-variables/tree/next/dist/scss).

If you are unsure of how a mixin is intended to be used, you can search for the name in the [Cedar component source](https://github.com/rei/rei-cedar/tree/next/src/components).

## Development

The `/dist` folder in this project should never be edited directly as it is meant to stay in sync with Cedar. This package should be updated whenever component variable support is added to a new component, or whenever the markup/styling for a supported component changes.

Update steps:
- Ensure that your copy of `rei-cedar` and `rei-cedar-component-variables` are in the same directory
- Run the `build:variables` script in `rei-cedar` to copy the variable files for all supported components into this repository. If you are adding support for a component, you will need to update that build script. If there are no changes to the `/dist` directory, then there is no need to do anything else.
- Run the `build:less` script inside this repository to create a LESS copy of the previous SASS export
- Update the `@rei/cdr-tokens` and `@rei/cedar` dependencies in this project's `package.json` to match the versions used to generate the component variables.
- Update `/examples` as needed.
- Bump the version of this package

### Adding Examples to the Doc-site

The examples generated by this project demonstrate how the component variables can be used to re-create the Vue.js Cedar components.

That data is stored as JSON which uses the following structure:

```
{
  "name": "Example Name (i.e, default, primary, secondary).",
  "html": "HTML to use for exmaple. Should reference the generated class name for this example",
  "scss": [
    "SCSS code used to build variables example CSS",
    "another line of SCSS",
    "these will be compiled into a CSS class with the same name as this example"
  ],
}
```

See [the examples directory](https://github.com/rei/rei-cedar-component-variables/tree/master/examples) for more instances of how this JSON is constructed, or the [Example component](TODO) to see how this JSON is translated into the doc site.
